# Welcome to the Studio Ghibli Discovery Application!

This is a C# program that reads from the public Studio Ghibli API. Some of the data is stored in hashtables in order to perform various manipulations on the data grids. So far, the user can view information about a film, characters within the API based on applied filters--if any, and view information about other groups within the API.

**IN PROGRESS:** Possible features for Locations, Species, and Vehicles pages. My Favorites page that has a database including favorite movies and characters in respective tables.
